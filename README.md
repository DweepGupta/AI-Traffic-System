🔥 Overview

This project is an AI-powered smart traffic management system that:

- Detects vehicles using YOLOv8
- Uses Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning) for signal optimization
- Dynamically adjusts traffic signals
- Handles emergency vehicles
- Displays real-time data on a live dashboard

👉 Designed to simulate a real-world intelligent traffic junction

⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV 👁️  
- YOLOv8 🤖  
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) 🧠  
- Streamlit 📊  
- JSON / CSV 📁  

---

🧠 Key Features

🚗 1. Vehicle Detection (YOLOv8)

- Detects:
  - Cars
  - Bikes
  - Buses
  - Trucks
  - Bicycles
- Runs on 4-direction multi-camera input

---

🧠 2. Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)

- Implements Q-Learning for decision making
- Learns:
  - Which signal timing reduces congestion
  - Which lane should get priority

⚙️ How it works:

- State → Traffic density per lane
- Action → Signal duration / next direction
- Reward → Reduced waiting time / congestion

📁 Q-table is stored in:

data/q_table.json

👉 Enables:

- Persistent learning across cycles
- Smarter decisions over time

---

🚦 3. Smart Traffic Signal Control

- Dynamic green light timing
- Based on:
  - AI decisions (Q-learning)
  - Vehicle density
- No fixed timers

---

⚖️ 4. Fairness System (No Starvation)

- Tracks waiting time for each direction
- Ensures:
  - No lane is ignored
  - Balanced traffic flow

---

🚑 5. Emergency Vehicle Priority

- Manual trigger (N / E / S / W)
- Instantly turns signal green
- Siren activation
- 🚨 Dashboard shows EMERGENCY mode

---

⏸️ 6. Smart Timer Handling

- Timer pauses during emergency
- Resumes from exact same point
- No time loss (real-world simulation)

---

📊 7. Live Dashboard (Streamlit)

Displays:

- Current signal
- Time left / Emergency status
- Total challans
- Analytics

---

🧾 8. Auto Challan System

- Detects violations:
  - No helmet
  - No seatbelt
  - Overspeeding
- Stores in CSV

---

🎥 9. Multi-Camera Grid

- North, East, South, West views
- 2x2 layout
- Real-time detection boxes

---

🌙 10. Robust Detection System

Handles real-world challenges:

✔ Night Conditions

- Improved visibility using frame enhancement

✔ Shadows

- Reduces false detections

✔ Occlusion

- Handles partially hidden vehicles

👉 Makes detection more reliable

⚙️ How It Works

🔄 Pipeline

1. Video input → YOLO detection
2. Vehicle count per direction
3. Q-learning evaluates best action
4. Signal controller updates timing
5. Dashboard updates in real-time

---

🎮 Controls

Key | Action
N |  Emergency North
